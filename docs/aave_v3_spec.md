## Protocol Overview

### What is Aave V3?

Aave V3 is a **non-custodial, open-source liquidity protocol** that enables users to:
- **Supply assets** to earn interest
- **Borrow assets** against collateral
- **Participate as liquidators** to maintain protocol health

The protocol operates through smart contracts on Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains, with no intermediaries holding user funds.

### Key Features

- **Multi-collateral positions**: Users can supply multiple assets and borrow against their entire portfolio
- **Over-collateralization**: All loans must be over-collateralized to protect lenders
- **Dynamic interest rates**: Rates adjust algorithmically based on supply and demand
- **Instant liquidity**: No lock-up periods; withdraw anytime (if not used as collateral for active borrows)
- **Flash loans**: Uncollateralized loans that must be repaid within the same transaction
- **Efficiency Mode (E-Mode)**: Higher capital efficiency for correlated assets

### Protocol Architecture

**Multi-Market Deployment:**

Aave V3 uses a **multi-market architecture** where each market is an independent instance of the protocol with:
- Its own Pool contract
- Its own set of supported assets (reserves)
- Isolated liquidity
- Independent risk parameters
- Separate user positions

**Examples of Aave V3 Markets:**

On Ethereum Mainnet alone, there are multiple markets including:
- **Core Market**: The primary Aave V3 deployment with broad asset support
- **Horizon Market**: Newer market with specific asset focus
- **Prime Market**: Institutional-focused market
- Each operates independently with isolated liquidity and reserves

**Multi-Chain Deployments:**

Aave V3 is deployed across numerous blockchain networks, including:
- Ethereum Mainnet
- Polygon
- Arbitrum
- Optimism
- Avalanche
- Base
- And many others

Each chain can host one or multiple independent markets, all sharing the same core protocol design.

**Note on Protocol Versions:**

Aave V3 has evolved through multiple versions (currently at v3.6 as of January 2026). The core protocol mechanics remain consistent across versions, but **newer versions introduce additional events and features**:

**Version History & Event Additions:**

- **V3.0-V3.2**: Core protocol events (Supply, Borrow, Repay, Withdraw, LiquidationCall, FlashLoan, etc.)
- **V3.3 (January 2025)**: Added **deficit tracking & liquidation optimizations**
  - New events: `DeficitCreated`, `DeficitCovered`
  - Markets: Core, Horizon
- **V3.4 (June 2025)**: Added **Multicall & Position Manager** features
  - New events: `PositionManagerApproved`, `PositionManagerRevoked`
  - Markets: Core only
- **V3.5-V3.6**: Further optimizations (no new events relevant for indexing)

**Markets may use different versions:**
- **Core Market**: V3.4+ (includes deficit tracking + position manager events)
- **Horizon Market**: V3.3+ (includes deficit tracking events)
- **Prime Market**: V3.0-V3.2 (standard events only)
- **Other chains**: Vary by deployment

When indexing, verify which events are present in your specific Pool contract ABI.

## Core Concepts & Mechanics

### Markets & Isolation

**What is a Market?**

In Aave V3, a **Market** is an isolated deployment of the protocol with its own:
- Pool contract
- Set of supported assets (reserves)
- Liquidity pools
- Risk parameters
- User positions

**Multi-Market Architecture:**
- Users interact with each market separately
- Positions in one market do not affect positions in another
- Each market has its own health factor calculation
- Liquidations occur per market, not across markets

**Examples:**
- Ethereum Mainnet hosts multiple markets (Core, Horizon, Prime)
- Each has different assets, risk parameters, and use cases

**Cross-Chain Deployments:**
Aave V3 is deployed across many chains (Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, Base, etc.), with each chain potentially hosting one or multiple independent markets.

### Multi-Collateral Positions

**How Users Supply Multiple Assets:**

1. User supplies Asset A (e.g., 10 ETH)
   - Receives aTokenA (e.g., 10 aWETH)
   - Can enable as collateral

2. User supplies Asset B (e.g., 5,000 USDC)
   - Receives aTokenB (e.g., 5,000 aUSDC)
   - Can enable as collateral

3. User's borrowing power = Sum of (Asset Value × LTV) for all collateral-enabled assets

**Borrowing Against Portfolio:**

- Each asset has its own **Loan-to-Value (LTV)** ratio
- User's total borrowing power is calculated as:
  ```
  Max Borrow = Σ (Collateral Asset Value × Asset LTV)
  ```
- Example with ETH (80% LTV) and USDC (85% LTV):
  ```
  10 ETH × $2,000 × 0.80 = $16,000
  5,000 USDC × $1 × 0.85 = $4,250
  Total Max Borrow = $20,250
  ```

**Position Aggregation:**

The protocol tracks positions at multiple levels:
- **Per-asset positions**: Individual supply/borrow amounts per reserve
- **Aggregate account data**: Total collateral, total debt, health factor across all assets
- **Collateral enablement**: Users can toggle which assets to use as collateral

### aTokens (Interest-Bearing Tokens)

**What are aTokens?**

aTokens are **ERC-20 tokens** that represent a user's supply position in a reserve. They:
- Are minted 1:1 when users supply assets
- Accrue interest in real-time
- Can be transferred between addresses
- Can be used in other DeFi protocols (composability)

**Example:** Supplying 100 USDC → Receive 100 aUSDC

**Interest Accrual Mechanism:**

Aave uses a **scaled balance** system for gas-efficient interest accrual:

1. **Scaled Balance**: The "principal" amount stored on-chain
   ```
   scaledBalance = balance / liquidityIndex
   ```

2. **Liquidity Index**: Grows continuously based on interest rates
   - Starts at 1.0 (with 27 decimal precision - "ray")
   - Increases every block based on liquidityRate
   - Formula: `newIndex = oldIndex × (1 + liquidityRate × timeDelta / secondsPerYear)`

3. **Current Balance**: Calculated on-the-fly
   ```
   currentBalance = scaledBalance × currentLiquidityIndex
   ```

**Why Scaled Balances?**
- Avoid updating every user's balance on every block (expensive)
- Store one index per reserve instead of N balances
- Users' real balances grow automatically as the index grows

**Transfer Mechanics:**

- aTokens are **fully transferable** ERC-20 tokens
- Transfers move supply positions between addresses
- **Important for indexing**: Users can receive aTokens without calling `supply()`
- Interest continues accruing for whoever holds the aTokens

### Interest Rate Model

**Utilization-Based Rates:**

Interest rates in Aave adjust automatically based on **utilization rate**:

```
Utilization Rate (U) = Total Borrowed / Total Supply
```

Where `Total Supply = Total Borrowed + Available Liquidity`

**Two-Slope Rate Model:**

Aave uses a piecewise linear model with two slopes:

```
if U < U_optimal:
    borrowRate = baseRate + (U / U_optimal) × slope1
else:
    borrowRate = baseRate + slope1 + ((U - U_optimal) / (1 - U_optimal)) × slope2
```

**Parameters:**
- **Base Rate**: Minimum borrow rate when utilization is 0%
- **Optimal Utilization (U_optimal)**: Target utilization (e.g., 80%)
- **Slope 1**: Rate increase from 0% to optimal utilization
- **Slope 2**: Steep increase beyond optimal (incentivizes repayment)

**Supply vs Borrow Rates:**

```
Supply APY = Borrow APY × Utilization Rate × (1 - Reserve Factor)
```

- **Borrow APY**: Rate borrowers pay
- **Supply APY**: Rate suppliers earn (always < Borrow APY)
- **Reserve Factor**: Percentage taken by protocol treasury (e.g., 10%)

**Rate Updates:**

- Rates update on every state-changing transaction (supply, borrow, repay, withdraw)
- `ReserveDataUpdated` event emitted with new rates
- Each reserve has its own interest rate strategy contract

**Example Rate Curve (USDC):**
- Base Rate: 0%
- Optimal Utilization: 90%
- Slope 1: 4%
- Slope 2: 60%

If utilization is 95%:
```
borrowRate = 0% + 4% + ((0.95 - 0.90) / (1 - 0.90)) × 60%
          = 4% + (0.05 / 0.10) × 60%
          = 4% + 30% = 34% APY
```

### Health Factor & Risk Management

**Health Factor Formula:**

```
Health Factor = (Total Collateral in Base Currency × Weighted Avg Liquidation Threshold) / Total Debt in Base Currency
```

**Components:**

1. **Total Collateral in Base Currency:**
   - Sum of all collateral-enabled assets valued in base currency (USD)
   - `Collateral Value = Σ (aToken Balance × Asset Price)`

2. **Weighted Average Liquidation Threshold:**
   - Each asset has its own liquidation threshold (e.g., 85% for ETH, 90% for USDC)
   - Weighted by collateral value:
     ```
     Weighted LT = Σ (Asset Collateral Value × Asset LT) / Total Collateral Value
     ```

3. **Total Debt in Base Currency:**
   - Sum of all borrowed assets valued in base currency
   - `Total Debt = Σ (Debt Balance × Asset Price)`

**Example Calculation:**

User has:
- 10 ETH as collateral ($2,000/ETH, 85% LT) = $20,000 collateral × 0.85
- 5,000 USDC as collateral ($1/USDC, 90% LT) = $5,000 collateral × 0.90
- Borrowed 8,000 DAI ($1/DAI) = $8,000 debt

```
Weighted LT = ($20,000 × 0.85 + $5,000 × 0.90) / $25,000
            = ($17,000 + $4,500) / $25,000
            = 0.86 (86%)

Health Factor = ($25,000 × 0.86) / $8,000
              = $21,500 / $8,000
              = 2.69
```

**Interpretation:**

- **HF > 1.0**: Position is healthy (safe)
- **HF = 1.0**: Position is at liquidation threshold
- **HF < 1.0**: Position is **liquidatable**

**Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio:**

- LTV determines maximum initial borrowing power
- Always **lower** than liquidation threshold (safety buffer)
- Example: 80% LTV, 85% liquidation threshold → 5% safety buffer

**Risk Tiers:**

- **HF > 2.0**: Very safe
- **HF 1.5 - 2.0**: Moderate risk
- **HF 1.1 - 1.5**: Elevated risk
- **HF 1.0 - 1.1**: High risk (near liquidation)
- **HF < 1.0**: Liquidatable

### Liquidation Mechanics

**When Liquidations Occur:**

Liquidations are triggered when a user's Health Factor falls below 1.0, which can happen due to:
- Borrowed asset price increase
- Collateral asset price decrease
- Interest accrual increasing debt

**Liquidation Process:**

1. **Liquidator calls** `liquidationCall(collateralAsset, debtAsset, user, debtToCover, receiveAToken)`
   
2. **Protocol validates:**
   - User's HF < 1.0 (liquidatable)
   - Liquidator has sufficient debtAsset to repay
   - DebtToCover does not exceed close factor

3. **Protocol executes:**
   - Burns liquidator's debtAsset (repaying user's debt)
   - Transfers user's collateralAsset to liquidator (with bonus)
   - Updates user's position
   - Emits `LiquidationCall` event

**Close Factor:**

The maximum percentage of debt that can be liquidated in a single transaction:

- **If HF >= 0.95**: Max 50% of debt can be liquidated (partial liquidation)
- **If HF < 0.95**: Max 100% of debt can be liquidated (full liquidation)

This prevents over-liquidation and gives users a chance to restore health.

**Source:** These values are defined in the Aave V3 smart contracts: https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/LiquidationLogic.sol

**Liquidation Bonus:**

Liquidators receive a bonus (typically 5-10%) as incentive:

```
Collateral Received = (Debt Repaid × Debt Price / Collateral Price) × (1 + Liquidation Bonus)
```

**Example:**
- User has $10,000 USDC debt, $12,000 ETH collateral (HF = 0.95)
- Liquidation bonus: 5%
- Liquidator can repay up to $5,000 USDC (50% close factor)
- Liquidator receives: $5,000 × 1.05 = $5,250 worth of ETH

**receiveAToken Parameter:**

- `true`: Liquidator receives aTokens (continues earning interest)
- `false`: Liquidator receives underlying asset directly

**Liquidation Events:**

```solidity
event LiquidationCall(
    address indexed collateralAsset,
    address indexed debtAsset,
    address indexed user,
    uint256 debtToCover,
    uint256 liquidatedCollateralAmount,
    address liquidator,
    bool receiveAToken
);
```

### Efficiency Mode (E-Mode)

**What is E-Mode?**

Efficiency Mode allows **higher capital efficiency** (higher LTV/liquidation thresholds) when borrowing assets within the same **category** of correlated assets.

**Use Cases:**

1. **Stablecoin Category**: Borrow USDC against DAI collateral with 97% LTV (instead of 75%)
2. **ETH Derivatives**: Borrow ETH against stETH with 90% LTV (instead of 80%)

**How E-Mode Works:**

1. **E-Mode Categories** are defined per market (e.g., Category 1 = Stablecoins, Category 2 = ETH Correlated)

2. **Users opt-in** to a category by calling `setUserEMode(categoryId)`

3. **When in E-Mode:**
   - If borrowing AND collateral are both in the same category → Use E-Mode parameters
   - If borrowing OR collateral are outside category → Use standard parameters
   - Category 0 = E-Mode disabled (default)

**E-Mode Parameters:**

Each category defines:
- **LTV**: Maximum borrow amount (e.g., 97% for stablecoins)
- **Liquidation Threshold**: Health factor trigger (e.g., 98%)
- **Liquidation Bonus**: Liquidator incentive (e.g., 2%)
- **Price Source**: Optional custom oracle for category

**Example:**

Standard Mode:
- Supply 10,000 DAI (75% LTV) → Borrow max 7,500 USDC

E-Mode (Stablecoin category, 97% LTV):
- Supply 10,000 DAI → Borrow max 9,700 USDC

**Risk Trade-Off:**

- Higher capital efficiency → Higher liquidation risk
- Small price deviations between category assets can cause liquidations
- Designed for highly correlated assets only

**Health Factor in E-Mode:**

When in E-Mode, the health factor calculation uses **category-specific parameters** for assets within the category, and standard parameters for assets outside:

```
HF = (In-Category Collateral × Category LT + Out-Category Collateral × Standard LT) / Total Debt
```

**Events:**

```solidity
event UserEModeSet(
    address indexed user,
    uint8 categoryId
);
```

### Reserves & Parameters

**What is a Reserve?**

A **reserve** represents a specific asset market within an Aave pool. Each reserve is a configured lending market for one asset (e.g., WETH reserve, USDC reserve).

**Reserve Configuration:**

Each reserve has associated contracts:
- **Underlying Asset**: The actual token (e.g., WETH, USDC)
- **aToken**: Interest-bearing token for suppliers
- **Variable Debt Token**: Tracks variable rate borrows
- **Stable Debt Token**: Tracks stable rate borrows (deprecated in V3)
- **Interest Rate Strategy**: Contract defining rate curves

**Key Reserve Parameters:**

#### Core Risk Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Example Value | Importance |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|------------|
| **LTV (Loan-to-Value)** | Maximum borrowing power when used as collateral. Expressed as percentage (basis points). | 80% (8000 bps) = Borrow $80 per $100 supplied | Determines initial borrowing capacity. Lower = safer but less capital efficient. |
| **Liquidation Threshold** | Health factor trigger point. When debt reaches this % of collateral value, position becomes liquidatable. | 85% (8500 bps) = Liquidatable if debt reaches 85% of collateral | Critical for liquidation risk. Always > LTV to provide safety buffer. |
| **Liquidation Bonus** | Extra collateral liquidators receive as incentive. | 5% (10500 bps represents 105%) = Liquidator receives $105 collateral per $100 debt | Higher bonus = stronger liquidation incentive but higher cost to borrowers. |
| **Reserve Factor** | Percentage of interest revenue allocated to protocol treasury. | 10% (1000 bps) = 10% of interest goes to treasury | Balances protocol revenue with competitive supply APY. |

#### Supply & Borrow Limits

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Supply Cap** | Maximum total supply allowed for the reserve. Prevents over-concentration. | 1,000,000 USDC |
| **Borrow Cap** | Maximum total borrows allowed for the reserve. Risk management tool. | 800,000 USDC |
| **Debt Ceiling** | Maximum debt allowed when reserve is used as isolated collateral (isolation mode). | 10,000,000 USD |

#### Interest Rate Strategy

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Interest Rate Strategy Address** | Address of contract defining rate curves (base rate, optimal utilization, slopes). |
| **Base Variable Borrow Rate** | Minimum borrow rate at 0% utilization. |
| **Optimal Utilization** | Target utilization rate (inflection point in rate curve). |
| **Variable Rate Slope 1** | Rate increase per utilization % before optimal. |
| **Variable Rate Slope 2** | Steep rate increase beyond optimal utilization. |

#### Operational Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Usage as Collateral Enabled** | Whether asset can be enabled as collateral by users. |
| **Borrowing Enabled** | Whether asset can be borrowed from the reserve. |
| **Stable Rate Enabled** | Whether stable rate borrowing is allowed (deprecated in V3). |
| **Is Active** | Reserve is operational and accepting transactions. |
| **Is Frozen** | Reserve only allows repay/withdraw, no new supply/borrow. |
| **Is Paused** | Reserve is completely paused (emergency only). |

#### E-Mode & Isolation

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **E-Mode Category** | Which efficiency mode category this reserve belongs to (0 = none). |
| **Isolation Mode Total Debt** | Current total debt when reserve is used as isolated collateral. |

**Detailed Parameter Explanations:**

**1. LTV vs Liquidation Threshold:**
- **LTV**: Guards initial borrowing (prevents over-leveraging at start)
- **Liquidation Threshold**: Guards against liquidation (provides safety buffer)
- **Gap**: Typically 5-10% buffer between them
- Example: 75% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold → 5% buffer before liquidation risk

**2. Reserve Factor Impact:**
```
Supplier receives: Borrow Rate × Utilization × (1 - Reserve Factor)
Protocol receives: Borrow Rate × Utilization × Reserve Factor

Example with 10% reserve factor, 80% utilization, 5% borrow rate:
- Suppliers earn: 5% × 0.80 × 0.90 = 3.6% APY
- Protocol earns: 5% × 0.80 × 0.10 = 0.4% APY
```

**3. Supply/Borrow Caps:**
- Protect against governance attacks or oracle failures
- Limit potential loss in worst-case scenarios
- Can be updated via governance
- 0 = no cap

**4. Isolation Mode:**
- Restricts borrowing when isolated asset is used as collateral
- Only allows borrowing stablecoins up to debt ceiling
- Prevents systemic risk from new/volatile assets
- Indicated by non-zero debt ceiling

**Reserve Discovery:**

Reserves are initialized via the `ReserveInitialized` event:

```solidity
event ReserveInitialized(
    address indexed asset,
    address indexed aToken,
    address stableDebtToken,
    address variableDebtToken,
    address interestRateStrategyAddress
);
```

## Smart Contracts

### Pool Contract

**Purpose:** Main entry point for all user interactions with the protocol. Each Pool has its own contract address.

**Core Functions:**

```solidity
// Supply asset to earn interest
function supply(address asset, uint256 amount, address onBehalfOf, uint16 referralCode)

// Withdraw supplied asset
function withdraw(address asset, uint256 amount, address to) returns (uint256)

// Borrow asset against collateral
function borrow(address asset, uint256 amount, uint256 interestRateMode, uint16 referralCode, address onBehalfOf)

// Repay borrowed asset
function repay(address asset, uint256 amount, uint256 interestRateMode, address onBehalfOf) returns (uint256)

// Liquidate undercollateralized position
function liquidationCall(address collateral, address debt, address user, uint256 debtToCover, bool receiveAToken)

// Execute flash loan
function flashLoan(address receiverAddress, address[] assets, uint256[] amounts, uint256[] modes, address onBehalfOf, bytes params, uint16 referralCode)

// Enable/disable asset as collateral
function setUserUseReserveAsCollateral(address asset, bool useAsCollateral)

// Set user's E-Mode category
function setUserEMode(uint8 categoryId)

// Get user's aggregate account data
function getUserAccountData(address user) returns (
    uint256 totalCollateralBase,
    uint256 totalDebtBase,
    uint256 availableBorrowsBase,
    uint256 currentLiquidationThreshold,
    uint256 ltv,
    uint256 healthFactor
)

    bool borrowableInIsolation;         // Can be borrowed in isolation
    // Additional fields (may vary by version)
    uint128 virtualUnderlyingBalance;   // Virtual balance (if applicable)
    uint128 deficit;                    // Deficit (if applicable)
}
```

**Important: Calculating Total Supply and Total Borrow**

The struct provides `totalScaledVariableDebt` (scaled value) and `availableLiquidity` (direct value). To get actual totals, you MUST calculate:

```
Total Borrowed = totalScaledVariableDebt × variableBorrowIndex / 1e27
Total Supply = Total Borrowed + availableLiquidity
```

There are NO pre-calculated `totalDebt` or `totalSupply` fields - you must derive them from the scaled values.
```

**UserReserveData Structure:**

```solidity
struct UserReserveData {
    address underlyingAsset;
    // Balances (scaled)
    uint256 scaledATokenBalance;        // Scaled supply balance
    uint256 scaledVariableDebt;         // Scaled variable debt
    uint256 principalStableDebt;        // Stable debt principal
    // Current balances (with accrued interest)
    uint256 currentATokenBalance;       // Current supply balance
    uint256 currentVariableDebt;        // Current variable debt
    uint256 currentStableDebt;          // Current stable debt
    // Collateral & rates
    bool usageAsCollateralEnabled;      // Is this asset enabled as collateral?
    uint256 stableBorrowRate;           // User's stable borrow rate
    uint40 stableBorrowLastUpdateTimestamp; // Last stable rate update
}
```

**Why UiPoolDataProviderV3 is Critical for Indexing:**

1. **Batch Queries**: Get all reserves or all user positions in a single call
2. **Calculated Values**: Returns current balances (scaled × index) pre-calculated
3. **Price Data**: Includes asset prices from oracle
4. **Efficient RPC Usage**: Reduces number of calls dramatically vs querying Pool directly

**Usage in Indexer:**

- `getReservesData()`: Called periodically to capture market snapshots (rates, prices, liquidity)
- `getUserReservesData()`: Called per user to capture position snapshots (balances, debt, collateral status)
- Combined with `Pool.getUserAccountData()` for complete user health data

### PoolAddressesProvider

**Purpose:** Central registry for all core protocol contract addresses. Used for contract discovery. Each Pool has its own PoolAddressesProvider.

**Key Functions:**

```solidity
// Get Pool contract address
function getPool() returns (address)

// Get price oracle address
function getPriceOracle() returns (address)

// Get ACL (Access Control List) manager
function getACLManager() returns (address)

// Get pool configurator
function getPoolConfigurator() returns (address)
```

**Usage in Indexer:**
- Pass to `UiPoolDataProviderV3.getUserReservesData()` to specify which pool to query
- Discover oracle address for price feeds

### AaveOracle

**Purpose:** Price feed aggregator providing asset prices in base currency (USD with 8 decimals).

**Key Functions:**

```solidity
// Get asset price in base currency
function getAssetPrice(address asset) returns (uint256)

// Get multiple asset prices
function getAssetsPrices(address[] assets) returns (uint256[])
```

**Price Precision:**
- 8 decimals in USD (e.g., 2000_00000000 = $2,000.00)

**Note:** Prices are also included in `UiPoolDataProviderV3.getReservesData()` as `priceInMarketReferenceCurrency`, which is often more convenient for indexing.

### AToken Contracts

**Purpose:** Interest-bearing ERC-20 tokens representing supply positions. Each reserve in each Pool has its own aToken contract (e.g., aWETH, aUSDC, aDAI).

**Key Characteristics:**

1. **ERC-20 Compliant**: Fully transferable tokens
2. **1:1 Minting**: Minted on supply, burned on withdraw
3. **Interest Bearing**: Balance grows automatically via scaled balance mechanism
4. **Composable**: Can be used in other DeFi protocols

**Key Functions:**

```solidity
// Standard ERC-20
function balanceOf(address user) returns (uint256) // Returns current balance with interest
function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) returns (bool)
function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) returns (bool)

// Aave-specific
function scaledBalanceOf(address user) returns (uint256) // Returns scaled balance
function getScaledUserBalanceAndSupply(address user) returns (uint256, uint256)
```

**Events:**

```solidity
event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value)
event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value)
```

**Why Transfer Events Matter for Indexing:**

- Users can receive aTokens via direct transfer (not just via supply())
- Must track Transfer events to discover all users with positions
- Critical for complete user discovery (see Architecture Considerations section below)

**Important for Indexing:**
- Track `Transfer` events on ALL aToken contracts
- Track both `from` and `to` addresses
- Filter out zero address (minting/burning) and Aave helper contract address

## Indexing Methodology

This section describes how to comprehensively index Aave V3 to track and derive all protocol state, user positions, and historical data.

### Event-Based Indexing

**Purpose:** Capture all state-changing transactions in real-time by listening to Pool contract events.

**Events to Index:**

#### Core Transaction Events

| Event | Emitted When | Key Data |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| `Supply` | User supplies asset | reserve, user, onBehalfOf, amount, referralCode |
| `Withdraw` | User withdraws asset | reserve, user, to, amount |
| `Borrow` | User borrows asset | reserve, user, onBehalfOf, amount, interestRateMode, borrowRate, referralCode |
| `Repay` | User repays debt | reserve, user, repayer, amount, useATokens |
| `LiquidationCall` | Position liquidated | collateralAsset, debtAsset, user, debtToCover, liquidatedCollateralAmount, liquidator, receiveAToken |

#### Reserve & Market Events

| Event | Emitted When | Key Data |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| `ReserveDataUpdated` | Interest rates/indexes update | reserve, liquidityRate, stableBorrowRate, variableBorrowRate, liquidityIndex, variableBorrowIndex |
| `ReserveUsedAsCollateralEnabled` | User enables collateral | reserve, user |
| `ReserveUsedAsCollateralDisabled` | User disables collateral | reserve, user |
| `IsolationModeTotalDebtUpdated` | Isolation debt changes | asset, totalDebt |
| `MintedToTreasury` | Interest sent to treasury | reserve, amountMinted |

#### User Configuration Events

| Event | Emitted When | Key Data |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| `UserEModeSet` | User changes E-Mode | user, categoryId |
| `SwapBorrowRateMode` | User swaps rate mode | reserve, user, interestRateMode |

#### Market-Specific Events

These events are only present in certain Aave V3 markets (not universal across all Aave V3 deployments):

| Event | Markets | Emitted When | Key Data |
|-------|---------|--------------|----------|
| `DeficitCreated` | Core, Horizon | Deficit created | reserve, user, amountCovered |
| `DeficitCovered` | Core, Horizon | Deficit covered | reserve, caller, amountCovered |
| `PositionManagerApproved` | Core only | Manager approved | user, positionManager |
| `PositionManagerRevoked` | Core only | Manager revoked | user, positionManager |
| `BackUnbacked` | Horizon | Unbacked backed | reserve, backer, amount, fee |
| `MintUnbacked` | Horizon | Unbacked minted | reserve, user, onBehalfOf, amount, referralCode |

#### aToken Events

**Critical for Complete User Discovery:** Track `Transfer` events on all aToken contracts to discover users who receive tokens via direct transfers (not through Pool interactions).

| Event | Contract | Emitted When | Key Data |
|-------|----------|--------------|----------|
| `Transfer` | aToken | aTokens transferred between addresses | from, to, value |
| `Mint` | aToken | aTokens minted (supply) | from (0x0), to, value, index |
| `Burn` | aToken | aTokens burned (withdraw) | from, to (0x0), value, index |

**Why These Matter:**
- **Transfer**: Users can receive supply positions without calling `supply()` - critical for complete user discovery
- **Mint/Burn**: Alternative to tracking Pool `Supply`/`Withdraw` events (see note below)

**Filter addresses to ignore:**
- Zero address (`0x000...000`) for Mint/Burn
- Pool contract address (internal accounting)
- Gateway contracts (e.g., WrappedTokenGatewayV3)

**Alternative Approach: Track aToken Events Instead of Pool Events**

Instead of (or in addition to) tracking Pool events for supply/withdraw operations, you can track aToken Mint/Burn/Transfer events:

**Benefits:**
- **Single source of truth**: aToken balance changes are the ground truth for supply positions
- **Simpler logic**: No need to reconcile Pool events with aToken state
- **Catches edge cases**: Captures all balance changes including rare internal operations

**Trade-offs:**
- **Missing context**: Mint/Burn events don't include `onBehalfOf` or `referralCode` parameters
- **Multiple contracts**: Must listen to events from all aToken contracts (discovered via `ReserveInitialized`)
- **Index parameter**: Mint/Burn include the `index` at time of operation, useful for scaled balance tracking

**Recommended Approach:**
Track both Pool events (for complete transaction context) AND aToken Transfer events (for user discovery). This provides complete coverage with full context.

**Implementation:**

For each event, the indexer should:
- Store the event data in the database
- Update the user's position state
- Track the user as active
- Update scaled balance snapshots (for offchain accounting optimization)

**Event indexing captures:**
- Complete transaction history
- User activity timeline
- Real-time position updates
- Liquidation events
- Reserve parameter changes
- All supply position transfers between users

### aToken Transfer Tracking

**See Also:** The complete list of aToken events (Transfer, Mint, Burn) is documented in the [Event-Based Indexing](#event-based-indexing) section above.

**Critical Issue:** Event-based indexing of Pool events alone misses users who receive aTokens without calling `supply()`.

**Problem Scenario:**

1. Alice supplies 100 USDC → Receives 100 aUSDC (emits Pool `Supply` + aToken `Mint`)
2. Alice transfers 50 aUSDC to Bob (direct ERC-20 transfer, emits aToken `Transfer`)
3. Bob now has a position but never emitted a Pool `Supply` event
4. **Without transfer tracking, Bob is invisible to the indexer**

**Solution:** Index aToken `Transfer`, `Mint`, and `Burn` events on all aToken contracts.

**Events to Track:**

| Event | Purpose | Key Addresses |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| `Transfer` | Track position transfers between users | `from`, `to` (both non-zero) |
| `Mint` | Alternative to Pool `Supply` event | `from` = 0x0, `to` = receiver |
| `Burn` | Alternative to Pool `Withdraw` event | `from` = burner, `to` = 0x0 |

**Implementation:**

For each aToken contract in the market, track events:

1. **Filter addresses to ignore:**
   - Zero address (`0x000...000`) - only in `from` for Mint, only in `to` for Burn
   - Pool contract address - internal accounting
   - Gateway contracts (e.g., WrappedTokenGatewayV3)

2. **Process valid events:**
   - **Transfer** (non-zero from/to): Mark both sender and recipient as active users
   - **Mint** (from=0x0): Mark `to` address as active user
   - **Burn** (to=0x0): Update `from` address position
   - Update supply positions and scaled balance snapshots for affected users

3. **Key data to capture:**
   - Amount (value)
   - Sender and recipient addresses (from, to)
   - Block number and timestamp
   - Transaction hash and log index
   - Index parameter (for Mint/Burn events - useful for scaled balance verification)

**Using Mint/Burn vs. Pool Supply/Withdraw Events:**

You can choose to index either:
- **Option A**: Pool events (`Supply`, `Withdraw`) + aToken `Transfer` - provides transaction context
- **Option B**: aToken events only (`Mint`, `Burn`, `Transfer`) - single source of truth, simpler
- **Option C**: Both (recommended) - complete coverage with context and verification

**Benefits:**

- **Complete user discovery** (no silent positions)
- Accurate active user count
- Position correctness for all users
- Full snapshot coverage
- Verification of Pool events against aToken state

**Discovery:**
aToken addresses can be discovered by monitoring `ReserveInitialized` events emitted by the Pool contract during reserve setup.

### Snapshot-Based Indexing

**Purpose:** Periodically query smart contracts directly to capture complete protocol state at specific blocks.

**Why Snapshots?**

1. **Ground Truth**: On-chain state is always correct (events can be missed or misprocessed)
2. **Interest Accrual**: Balances grow between transactions; snapshots capture this
3. **Health Factors**: Dynamically calculated based on current prices and indexes
4. **Efficiency**: Batch query multiple users via multicall
5. **Historical Analysis**: Time-series data for positions and markets

**Snapshot Frequency:**

- Choose granularity based on requirements (e.g., per block, hourly, daily)
- Can trigger on-demand: After liquidations or major market events
- Trade-off: More frequent snapshots = more accurate but higher storage/compute costs

**Implementation:**

At each snapshot interval:

1. **Get active users** from tracking table
2. **Batch query smart contracts** (100-200 users per batch):
   - `Pool.getUserAccountData(user)` → UserAccountSnapshot (aggregate health)
   - `UiPoolDataProviderV3.getUserReservesData(provider, user)` → UserReserveSnapshot (per-asset positions)
   - `UiPoolDataProviderV3.getReservesData(provider)` → ReserveMarketSnapshot (market-wide data, once per batch)
3. **Store** all snapshot data to database

#### 1. UserAccountSnapshot

**Note:** These are the core fields. The complete `AggregatedReserveData` struct (documented above) includes additional fields like `name`, `symbol`, `decimals`, `reserveFactor`, `aTokenAddress`, rate model parameters, caps, and more. Store additional fields based on your indexing requirements.

**Use Cases:**

- **Get asset prices** at any historical block (critical for liquidation analysis)
- Calculate interest rates (APY conversion)
- **Track total supply and borrow per reserve:**
  - `Total Borrowed = totalScaledVariableDebt × variableBorrowIndex / 1e27`
  - `Total Supply = Total Borrowed + availableLiquidity`
- **Calculate utilization rate:**
  - `Utilization = Total Borrowed / Total Supply`
- Monitor market conditions (frozen, paused states)
- Calculate total value locked (TVL)

### Derived Metrics

From the indexed events and snapshots, we can calculate comprehensive protocol metrics.

**Per-Reserve Metrics:**

1. **Total Supply:**
   ```
   Total Supply = (totalScaledVariableDebt × variableBorrowIndex / 1e27) + availableLiquidity
   ```
   Or equivalently: `Total Supply = Total Borrowed + Available Liquidity`
   
   This represents the sum of all user supply positions in the reserve.

2. **Total Borrowed:**
   ```
   Total Borrowed = totalScaledVariableDebt × variableBorrowIndex / 1e27
   ```
   
   This represents the sum of all user borrow positions in the reserve.

3. **Utilization Rate:**
   ```
   Utilization = Total Borrowed / Total Supply
   ```

4. **Supply APY & Borrow APY:**
   ```
   Supply APY = (liquidityRate / 1e27) × 100%
   Borrow APY = (variableBorrowRate / 1e27) × 100%
   ```

5. **TVL per Reserve:**
   ```
   TVL = Total Supply × Price in USD
   ```

**Protocol-Wide Metrics:**

- Total TVL across all reserves
- Total Debt across all reserves
- Active user count
- Users at risk count (1.0 < HF < 1.2)

**User-Specific Metrics:**

- Position value in USD
- Interest earned/paid
- Effective APY over time

### Position Backing Analysis

**Purpose:** Understand what collateral assets "back" a lender's supply position by analyzing the borrower side of the market.

**Use Case:** A lender wants to know the risk composition of their supply position - what types of collateral would be liquidated to repay their supplied assets in case of borrower defaults.

**Methodology:**

For a lender who has supplied Asset A:

1. **Identify all borrowers** of Asset A
2. **For each borrower**:
   - Calculate what portion of their collateral backs Asset A specifically
   - Allocation ratio = (Borrower's Asset A debt) / (Borrower's total debt)
   - Asset A-allocated collateral = Allocation ratio × Borrower's total collateral
3. **Sum up** all Asset A-allocated collateral across all borrowers to get total backing
4. **Calculate percentages** of each collateral type from the total backing (will sum to 100%)

**Basic Example (Single Borrow Type):**

```
Market State:
- Total USDC Supplied: 10,000 USDC
- Total USDC Borrowed: 8,000 USDC
- Alice is a lender with 10,000 USDC supplied (100% of supply)

Borrowers:
- Bob borrows 4,000 USDC (50% of total borrowed)
  - Collateral: $6,000 ETH + $2,000 WBTC = $8,000 total
  - Collateral composition: 75% ETH, 25% WBTC

- Carol borrows 4,000 USDC (50% of total borrowed)
  - Collateral: $8,000 DAI = $8,000 total
  - Collateral composition: 100% DAI

Alice's Position Backing Calculation:
- Bob's contribution: 50% × (75% ETH, 25% WBTC) = 37.5% ETH, 12.5% WBTC
- Carol's contribution: 50% × (100% DAI) = 50% DAI

Alice's USDC position is backed by:
- 37.5% ETH
- 12.5% WBTC
- 50.0% DAI
```

**Advanced Example (Multiple Borrow Types):**

When borrowers have multiple borrow positions, their collateral must be allocated proportionally across all their debts:

```
Market State (USDC lending):
- Total USDC Borrowed: 8,000 USDC
- Alice supplies 10,000 USDC

Borrowers:
- Bob borrows 4,000 USDC
  - Also borrows 2,000 DAI
  - Total borrows: $6,000 ($4,000 USDC + $2,000 DAI)
  - Collateral: $6,000 ETH + $3,000 WBTC = $9,000 total

- Carol borrows 4,000 USDC
  - Also borrows 4,000 DAI
  - Total borrows: $8,000 ($4,000 USDC + $4,000 DAI)
  - Collateral: $10,000 stETH = $10,000 total

Step 1: Calculate USDC-allocated collateral per borrower
(What portion of each borrower's collateral backs their USDC borrow)

Bob's USDC-allocated collateral:
- Allocation ratio: $4,000 USDC / $6,000 total borrows = 66.67%
- ETH backing USDC: 66.67% × $6,000 ETH = $4,000 ETH
- WBTC backing USDC: 66.67% × $3,000 WBTC = $2,000 WBTC

Carol's USDC-allocated collateral:
- Allocation ratio: $4,000 USDC / $8,000 total borrows = 50%
- stETH backing USDC: 50% × $10,000 stETH = $5,000 stETH

Step 2: Sum total collateral backing USDC market
Total USDC backing:
- $4,000 ETH (from Bob)
- $2,000 WBTC (from Bob)
- $5,000 stETH (from Carol)
- Total = $11,000 of collateral backing $8,000 borrowed

Step 3: Calculate backing composition as percentages
Alice's USDC position is backed by:
- ETH: $4,000 / $11,000 = 36.36%
- WBTC: $2,000 / $11,000 = 18.18%
- stETH: $5,000 / $11,000 = 45.45%
- Total = 100% ✓
```

**Implementation:**

```typescript
async function calculatePositionBacking(
  suppliedAsset: string,
  blockNumber: bigint
) {
  // 1. Get all borrowers of this asset at this block
  const borrowers = await getBorrowersOfAsset(suppliedAsset, blockNumber);
  
  // Map to accumulate total collateral backing this asset
  const totalBackingByAsset: Map<string, bigint> = new Map();
  let totalBackingUSD = 0n;
  
  // 2. For each borrower
  for (const borrower of borrowers) {
    // Get their full position data
    const positions = await getUserReservesData(borrower.address, blockNumber);
    
    // Calculate their total borrows value (across all assets)
    let totalBorrowsUSD = 0n;
    for (const position of positions) {
      if (position.currentVariableDebt > 0) {
        const borrowValueUSD = 
          (position.currentVariableDebt * position.priceUSD) / 10n ** position.decimals;
        totalBorrowsUSD += borrowValueUSD;
      }
    }
    
    // Get their borrow of the specific asset we're analyzing
    const borrowOfTargetAsset = positions.find(p => p.asset === suppliedAsset)?.currentVariableDebt || 0n;
    const borrowOfTargetAssetUSD = (borrowOfTargetAsset * assetPrice) / 10n ** assetDecimals;
    
    // Calculate allocation ratio: what % of their collateral backs this asset
    const allocationRatio = (borrowOfTargetAssetUSD * PRECISION) / totalBorrowsUSD;
    
    // Allocate their collateral proportionally
    for (const position of positions) {
      if (position.usageAsCollateralEnabled && position.currentATokenBalance > 0) {
        const collateralValueUSD = 
          (position.currentATokenBalance * position.priceUSD) / 10n ** position.decimals;
        
        // This much of their collateral backs the target asset
        const allocatedCollateralUSD = (collateralValueUSD * allocationRatio) / PRECISION;
        
        // Add to total backing
        const current = totalBackingByAsset.get(position.asset) || 0n;
        totalBackingByAsset.set(position.asset, current + allocatedCollateralUSD);
        totalBackingUSD += allocatedCollateralUSD;
      }
    }
  }
  
  // 3. Convert to percentages (basis points for precision)
  const backingCompositionBps: Map<string, number> = new Map();
  
  for (const [collateralAsset, collateralUSD] of totalBackingByAsset) {
    const bps = Number((collateralUSD * 10000n) / totalBackingUSD);
    backingCompositionBps.set(collateralAsset, bps);
  }
  
  return {
    backingByAsset: totalBackingByAsset,        // Absolute USD amounts
    backingCompositionBps: backingCompositionBps, // Percentages (basis points)
    totalBackingUSD: totalBackingUSD            // Total collateral backing
  };
}
```

**Important Limitations:**

**1. Methodology Choice:**
This is one approach to position backing analysis. Other methodologies might:
- Weight by liquidation risk rather than borrow amounts
- Consider time-to-liquidation based on health factors
- Account for correlation between supplied asset and collateral assets

**2. Inaccurate Picture with Mixed Collateral Types:**

The methodology treats all collateral equally, but borrowers often have heterogeneous collateral with vastly different liquidation probabilities:

```
Example - Misleading Backing with Mixed Collateral:
- Bob borrows 10,000 USDC
- Collateral: $15,000 USDT (stablecoin) + $15,000 BTC (volatile)
- Total collateral: $30,000
- Health Factor: 2.55 (very healthy)

Position Backing Calculation says:
- 50% backed by USDT
- 50% backed by BTC

Issue: This is misleading because of correlation effects:
- USDT and USDC are highly correlated (both ~$1)
- Even if BTC crashes 50% (to $7,500), Bob won't be liquidated
  - Remaining collateral: $15,000 USDT + $7,500 BTC = $22,500
  - Health Factor: ~1.91 (still healthy)
- BTC would need to drop ~85% before liquidation becomes possible
- The USDT acts as a "buffer" preventing liquidation

Reality: The BTC collateral is unlikely to ever flow to USDC suppliers 
because the correlated USDT prevents liquidation under most scenarios.

In contrast:
- Alice borrows 10,000 USDC
- Collateral: $15,000 BTC (no stablecoin buffer)
- Health Factor: 1.28

This position has real liquidation risk. If BTC drops ~20%, Alice gets 
liquidated and the BTC collateral flows to USDC suppliers.

The position backing calculation treats both as "backed by BTC",
but Bob's BTC backing is illusory while Alice's is real.
```

## Architecture Considerations

### Tracking Active Users via aToken Transfers

**Problem Statement:**

Users cannot be completely tracked by only monitoring Pool supply events. aTokens are **transferable ERC-20 tokens**, which means:

1. **Direct Transfers:** Users can receive aTokens via `transfer()` without ever calling `supply()`
2. **"Silent" Positions:** These users have active positions but aren't captured in event-based indexing
3. **Incomplete Snapshots:** Snapshot handlers won't know to query these users

**Example Scenario:**

```
Block 100: Alice calls supply(1000 USDC)
  → Pool emits Supply event
  → Alice receives 1000 aUSDC
  → Indexer tracks Alice ✅

Block 200: Alice calls aUSDC.transfer(Bob, 500)
  → aUSDC emits Transfer event
  → Bob receives 500 aUSDC
  → Bob now has a position
  → Without Transfer tracking: Bob is invisible ❌

Block 300: Snapshot runs
  → Queries Alice's position ✅
  → Doesn't query Bob (unknown user) ❌
  → Bob's 500 aUSDC is untracked
```

**Solution: Index aToken Events (Transfer, Mint, Burn)**

**See Also:** Complete details in the [aToken Transfer Tracking](#atoken-transfer-tracking) and [Event-Based Indexing](#event-based-indexing) sections.

**Step 1: Discover aToken Contracts**

Identify all aToken addresses for the Pool by:
- Monitoring `ReserveInitialized` events from the Pool contract
- Each event contains the aToken address for that reserve
- Track all aToken addresses to index their events

**Step 2: Choose Indexing Approach**

**Option A: Pool Events + aToken Transfers (Recommended)**
- Index Pool `Supply`/`Withdraw` events for transaction context
- Index aToken `Transfer` events for user discovery
- Provides complete coverage with full context

**Option B: aToken Events Only (Alternative)**
- Index aToken `Mint`/`Burn`/`Transfer` events exclusively
- Single source of truth, simpler reconciliation
- Missing some transaction context (onBehalfOf, referralCode)

**Step 3: Handle aToken Events**

For each aToken event:

1. **Filter addresses to ignore:**
   - Zero address (`0x000...000`) - for `from` in Mint, for `to` in Burn
   - Pool contract address - internal accounting
   - Gateway contracts - intermediate contracts, not end users

2. **Process valid events:**
   - **Transfer** (non-zero from/to): Add both `from` and `to` addresses to active user list
   - **Mint** (from=0x0): Add `to` address to active user list
   - **Burn** (to=0x0): Update `from` address position
   - Update position tracking for all affected users
   - Map aToken address to its underlying reserve
   - Store events for historical records (optional)

3. **Key data to capture:**
   - Amount (value)
   - Sender and recipient addresses
   - Block number and timestamp
   - Transaction hash and log index
   - Index parameter (for Mint/Burn events)

**Benefits:**

- **Complete user coverage** (no silent positions)
- **Accurate TVL** (all supply positions tracked)
- **Comprehensive snapshots** (all users queried)
- **Correct liquidation monitoring** (health factors for all users)
- **Verification capability** (cross-check Pool events against aToken events)

**Step 4: Use Active User List in Snapshots**

Query active users (including transfer recipients) when running snapshots to ensure complete coverage. See "Tracking Active Users" section below for implementation details.

### Tracking Active Users

**Purpose:** Maintain an accurate list of all users who currently have active positions (non-zero supply or debt) to optimize snapshot operations.

**Active User Table Schema:**

```typescript
ActiveUser {
  id: hex,                      // User address (primary key)
  firstSeenBlock: bigint,       // Block when user first interacted
  firstSeenTimestamp: bigint,   // Timestamp of first interaction
  lastActivityBlock: bigint,    // Block of most recent activity
  lastActivityTimestamp: bigint,// Timestamp of most recent activity
  hasActivePosition: boolean,   // TRUE if user has any supply or debt > 0
}
```

**Tracking Methodology:**

1. **User Discovery:**
   - Add user to `ActiveUser` table on first interaction (Supply, Borrow, aToken Transfer, etc.)
   - Set `hasActivePosition = true` initially
   - Record `firstSeenBlock` and `lastActivityBlock`

2. **Activity Updates:**
   - Update `lastActivityBlock` and `lastActivityTimestamp` on every user transaction
   - Update `hasActivePosition` flag based on actual position state

3. **Position Status Determination:**
   
   A user has an active position if:
   ```
   (Total Supply Balance > 0) OR (Total Debt Balance > 0)
   ```
   
   **After each transaction:**
   - Calculate user's total supply across all reserves
   - Calculate user's total debt across all reserves
   - Update `hasActivePosition = (totalSupply > 0 || totalDebt > 0)`

4. **Snapshot Optimization:**
   
   When running periodic snapshots:
   ```sql
   SELECT user FROM ActiveUser WHERE hasActivePosition = true
   ```
   
   This query returns only users with non-zero positions, dramatically reducing:
   - RPC calls to smart contracts
   - Database write operations
   - Snapshot computation time

**Benefits:**

- **Performance:** Skip users with zero balances during snapshots
- **Accuracy:** Always reflects current position status
- **Scalability:** As protocol grows, avoid querying inactive users
- **Cost:** Reduces RPC costs by eliminating unnecessary queries

**Implementation Note:** The `hasActivePosition` flag should be updated after every position-changing event (Supply, Withdraw, Borrow, Repay, Liquidation, aToken Transfer).

### Offchain Scaled Token Accounting Optimization

**Problem Statement:**

Calculating historical health factors for many users across many blocks requires knowing each user's exact balance and debt at each point in time. Naively, this would require:
- Making RPC calls to `Pool.getUserAccountData()` for every user at every snapshot block
- For example: 1,000 users × 365 snapshots = 365,000 RPC calls
- Expensive, slow, and hits rate limits on RPC providers

**Solution: Scaled Balance Tracking**

Instead of querying smart contracts for historical state, track **scaled balances** event-by-event and calculate current balances using Aave's interest accrual math offchain.

**Core Concept:**

Aave uses a **scaled balance system** where:
```
scaledBalance = currentBalance / liquidityIndex
currentBalance = scaledBalance × liquidityIndex
```

The `liquidityIndex` and `variableBorrowIndex` grow continuously based on interest rates. By tracking **scaled balances** (which only change on transactions) and **indexes** (which update on every transaction via `ReserveDataUpdated` events), we can calculate any user's balance at any historical block **without RPC calls**.

---

#### Scaled Balance Schema

**1. Supply Position Snapshots:**

```typescript
UserScaledSupplyPosition {
  id: text,                      // `${user}-${asset}-${blockNumber}`
  user: hex,
  asset: hex,
  blockNumber: bigint,           // Block of this snapshot
  timestamp: bigint,
  scaledBalance: bigint,         // Scaled aToken balance
  isCollateral: boolean,         // Whether asset is enabled as collateral
  lastLiquidityIndex: bigint,    // liquidityIndex at this block (27 decimals)
}
```

**2. Borrow Position Snapshots:**

```typescript
UserScaledBorrowPosition {
  id: text,                      // `${user}-${asset}-${blockNumber}`
  user: hex,
  asset: hex,
  blockNumber: bigint,
  timestamp: bigint,
  scaledVariableDebt: bigint,    // Scaled variable debt
  lastVariableBorrowIndex: bigint, // variableBorrowIndex at this block (27 decimals)
}
```

**3. E-Mode Tracking:**

```typescript
UserEModeCategory {
  id: text,                      // `${user}-${blockNumber}`
  user: hex,
  blockNumber: bigint,
  timestamp: bigint,
  categoryId: integer,           // E-Mode category (0 = disabled)
}
```

---

#### Event-by-Event Tracking

**Why Event-by-Event Tracking?**

Scaled balances only change when users perform transactions (Supply, Withdraw, Borrow, Repay, Liquidation, etc.). By capturing the scaled balance at each transaction block and storing the corresponding index, we can later reconstruct the exact balance at any historical block using only the index growth formula—**without needing to query the blockchain for historical state**.

This is the key optimization: instead of making thousands of historical RPC calls, we track deltas event-by-event and calculate historical balances offchain.

**⚠️ Critical: Handling Multiple Events in the Same Block**

When multiple position-changing events occur in the same block for the same user and asset, handlers must **not overwrite** previous updates from the same block. Since the snapshot ID is `${user}-${asset}-${blockNumber}`, multiple events in the same block share the same ID.

**Two Implementation Approaches:**

**Option 1: Check and Update Existing Snapshot (Recommended)**
```typescript
// Check if a snapshot already exists for this block
const existingSnapshot = getSnapshot(user, asset, blockNumber);

if (existingSnapshot) {
  // Multiple events in same block - update existing snapshot
  const newScaledBalance = existingSnapshot.scaledBalance + scaledAmount;
  updateUserScaledSupplyPosition({
    id: `${user}-${asset}-${blockNumber}`,
    scaledBalance: newScaledBalance,
    lastLiquidityIndex: currentIndex,
  });
} else {
  // First event in this block - create new snapshot based on previous block
  const prevSnapshot = getPreviousSnapshot(user, asset, blockNumber - 1);
  const newScaledBalance = (prevSnapshot?.scaledBalance || 0n) + scaledAmount;
  insertUserScaledSupplyPosition({...});
}
```

**Option 2: Use Log Index in ID**
```typescript
// Include transaction log index in ID to store all intermediate states
const id = `${user}-${asset}-${blockNumber}-${logIndex}`;

// Always get most recent snapshot up to and including current block
const prevSnapshot = getMostRecentSnapshot(user, asset, blockNumber); // <= not <
const newScaledBalance = (prevSnapshot?.scaledBalance || 0n) + scaledAmount;

insertUserScaledSupplyPosition({
  id,
  scaledBalance: newScaledBalance,
  ...
});
```

**Track scaled balances on every position-changing event:**

**Supply Event:**
```typescript
async function trackScaledSupply(user, asset, amount, blockNumber, timestamp) {
  // 1. Get current liquidityIndex from ReserveDataUpdated event
  const reserveData = getLatestReserveDataAtBlock(asset, blockNumber);
  const currentIndex = reserveData.liquidityIndex;
  
  // 2. Convert supplied amount to scaled balance
  const scaledAmount = (amount × RAY) / currentIndex;
  
  // 3. Check if snapshot already exists for this block (multiple events)
  const existingSnapshot = getSnapshot(user, asset, blockNumber);
  
  if (existingSnapshot) {
    // Multiple events in same block - update existing
    const newScaledBalance = existingSnapshot.scaledBalance + scaledAmount;
    updateUserScaledSupplyPosition({
      id: `${user}-${asset}-${blockNumber}`,
      scaledBalance: newScaledBalance,
      lastLiquidityIndex: currentIndex,
    });
  } else {
    // First event in this block - get from previous block
    const prevSnapshot = getPreviousSnapshot(user, asset, blockNumber - 1);
    const prevScaledBalance = prevSnapshot?.scaledBalance || 0n;
    const newScaledBalance = prevScaledBalance + scaledAmount;
    
    // Store new snapshot
    insertUserScaledSupplyPosition({
      id: `${user}-${asset}-${blockNumber}`,
      user,
      asset,
      blockNumber,
      timestamp,
      scaledBalance: newScaledBalance,
      isCollateral: prevSnapshot?.isCollateral ?? true,
      lastLiquidityIndex: currentIndex,
    });
  }
}
```

**Withdraw Event:**
```typescript
async function trackScaledWithdraw(user, asset, amount, blockNumber, timestamp) {
  // Calculate scaled amount to subtract
  const reserveData = getLatestReserveDataAtBlock(asset, blockNumber);
  const scaledAmount = (amount × RAY) / reserveData.liquidityIndex;
  
  // Check if snapshot already exists for this block
  const existingSnapshot = getSnapshot(user, asset, blockNumber);
  
  if (existingSnapshot) {
    // Multiple events in same block - update existing
    const newScaledBalance = existingSnapshot.scaledBalance - scaledAmount;
    updateUserScaledSupplyPosition({
      id: `${user}-${asset}-${blockNumber}`,
      scaledBalance: newScaledBalance >= 0n ? newScaledBalance : 0n,
      lastLiquidityIndex: reserveData.liquidityIndex,
    });
  } else {
    // First event in this block - get from previous block
    const prevSnapshot = getPreviousSnapshot(user, asset, blockNumber - 1);
    const newScaledBalance = prevSnapshot.scaledBalance - scaledAmount;
    
    // Store updated snapshot (even if balance becomes 0)
    insertUserScaledSupplyPosition({
      id: `${user}-${asset}-${blockNumber}`,
      user,
      asset,
      blockNumber,
      timestamp,
      scaledBalance: newScaledBalance >= 0n ? newScaledBalance : 0n,
      isCollateral: prevSnapshot?.isCollateral ?? true,
      lastLiquidityIndex: reserveData.liquidityIndex,
    });
  }
}
```

**Borrow/Repay Events:** Similar logic using `variableBorrowIndex` instead of `liquidityIndex`. Same rules apply for handling multiple events in the same block.

**Collateral Toggle Events:**
```typescript
async function trackCollateralEnabled(user, asset, blockNumber, timestamp) {
  // Check if snapshot already exists for this block
  const existingSnapshot = getSnapshot(user, asset, blockNumber);
  
  if (existingSnapshot) {
    // Update existing snapshot's collateral flag
    updateUserScaledSupplyPosition({
      id: `${user}-${asset}-${blockNumber}`,
      isCollateral: true,
    });
  } else {
    // Get previous block's snapshot and create new one with updated flag
    const prevSnapshot = getPreviousSnapshot(user, asset, blockNumber - 1);
    
    insertUserScaledSupplyPosition({
      id: `${user}-${asset}-${blockNumber}`,
      user,
      asset,
      blockNumber,
      timestamp,
      scaledBalance: prevSnapshot?.scaledBalance || 0n,
      isCollateral: true,  // Enable collateral
      lastLiquidityIndex: prevSnapshot?.lastLiquidityIndex || 0n,
    });
  }
}
```

**E-Mode Events:**
```typescript
async function trackEModeSet(user, categoryId, blockNumber, timestamp) {
  // E-Mode is per-user (not per-asset), so check if already set in this block
  const existingEMode = getEModeSnapshot(user, blockNumber);
  
  if (existingEMode) {
    // Update existing E-Mode setting for this block
    updateUserEModeCategory({
      id: `${user}-${blockNumber}`,
      categoryId,
    });
  } else {
    // Create new E-Mode snapshot
    insertUserEModeCategory({
      id: `${user}-${blockNumber}`,
      user,
      blockNumber,
      timestamp,
      categoryId,
    });
  }
}
```

#### Health Factor Calculation Using Scaled Balances

**Step-by-Step Process:**

**1. Get User's Latest Scaled Positions:**

For a given user at block N:
```sql
-- Get latest supply snapshot for each asset before or at block N
SELECT DISTINCT ON (asset)
  asset, scaledBalance, isCollateral, lastLiquidityIndex
FROM UserScaledSupplyPosition
WHERE user = $user AND blockNumber <= $blockN
ORDER BY asset, blockNumber DESC

-- Get latest borrow snapshot for each asset before or at block N
SELECT DISTINCT ON (asset)
  asset, scaledVariableDebt, lastVariableBorrowIndex
FROM UserScaledBorrowPosition
WHERE user = $user AND blockNumber <= $blockN
ORDER BY asset, blockNumber DESC

-- Get latest E-Mode setting before or at block N
SELECT categoryId
FROM UserEModeCategory
WHERE user = $user AND blockNumber <= $blockN
ORDER BY blockNumber DESC
LIMIT 1
```

**2. Calculate Current Indexes:**

For each reserve, get the latest `ReserveDataUpdated` event at or before block N:
```sql
SELECT liquidityRate, liquidityIndex, variableBorrowRate, variableBorrowIndex, timestamp
FROM ReserveDataUpdated
WHERE reserve = $asset AND blockNumber <= $blockN
ORDER BY blockNumber DESC
LIMIT 1
```

Then calculate current indexes using Aave's formula:
```typescript
function calculateCurrentIndex(
  lastIndex: bigint,
  lastRate: bigint,
  lastTimestamp: bigint,
  currentTimestamp: bigint
): bigint {
  const timeDelta = currentTimestamp - lastTimestamp;
  
  // Linear interest approximation: linearInterest = rate × timeDelta / secondsPerYear
  const linearInterest = (lastRate × timeDelta) / SECONDS_PER_YEAR;
  
  // newIndex = oldIndex × (1 + linearInterest)
  const newIndex = (lastIndex × (RAY + linearInterest)) / RAY;
  
  return newIndex;
}
```

**3. Calculate Current Balances:**

```typescript
// Supply balance with accrued interest
const currentBalance = (scaledBalance × currentLiquidityIndex) / RAY;

// Debt with accrued interest
const currentDebt = (scaledVariableDebt × currentVariableBorrowIndex) / RAY;
```

**4. Get Asset Prices:**

Asset prices must be fetched for each snapshot block to calculate USD values. Two approaches:

**Option A: Use Previously Stored Reserve Snapshots**
If you've already created `ReserveMarketSnapshot` records at this block:
```sql
SELECT priceInMarketReferenceCurrency
FROM ReserveMarketSnapshot
WHERE asset = $asset AND blockNumber = $blockN
```

**Option B: Query Directly from Smart Contract**
If snapshots don't exist yet, make an RPC call to get reserve data:
- Call `UiPoolDataProviderV3.getReservesData(provider)` at block N
- Extract `priceInMarketReferenceCurrency` for each reserve (8 decimals in USD)

**Important Note:** While this requires RPC calls, it's still a massive optimization:
- **Without optimization:** 1 RPC call per user per snapshot block
- **With optimization:** 1 RPC call per snapshot block (shared across all users)
- For 1,000 users: **99.9% reduction** in RPC calls (1 call vs. 1,000 calls per snapshot)

**5. Calculate Health Factor:**

```typescript
async function calculateHealthFactor(user, blockNumber, timestamp) {
  const supplyPositions = getLatestScaledSupplyPositions(user, blockNumber);
  const borrowPositions = getLatestScaledBorrowPositions(user, blockNumber);
  const eModeCategory = getLatestEModeCategory(user, blockNumber);
  
  let totalCollateralBase = 0n;
  let totalCollateralTimesLT = 0n;
  let totalDebtBase = 0n;
  
  // Calculate collateral
  for (const position of supplyPositions) {
    if (!position.isCollateral) continue;
    
    // Get current index and calculate current balance
    const reserveData = getLatestReserveData(position.asset, blockNumber);
    const currentIndex = calculateCurrentIndex(
      reserveData.liquidityIndex,
      reserveData.liquidityRate,
      reserveData.timestamp,
      timestamp
    );
    const currentBalance = (position.scaledBalance × currentIndex) / RAY;
    
    // Get price and reserve parameters
    const price = getAssetPrice(position.asset, blockNumber);
    const reserveConfig = getReserveConfiguration(position.asset);
    
    // Determine liquidation threshold (E-Mode or standard)
    let liquidationThreshold = reserveConfig.liquidationThreshold;
    if (eModeCategory > 0 && reserveConfig.eModeCategory === eModeCategory) {
      liquidationThreshold = getEModeLiquidationThreshold(eModeCategory);
    }
    
    // Calculate value in base currency (8 decimals)
    const valueBase = (currentBalance × price) / (10n ** assetDecimals);
    
    totalCollateralBase += valueBase;
    totalCollateralTimesLT += (valueBase × BigInt(liquidationThreshold)) / 10000n;
  }
  
  // Calculate debt
  for (const position of borrowPositions) {
    const reserveData = getLatestReserveData(position.asset, blockNumber);
    const currentIndex = calculateCurrentIndex(
      reserveData.variableBorrowIndex,
      reserveData.variableBorrowRate,
      reserveData.timestamp,
      timestamp
    );
    const currentDebt = (position.scaledVariableDebt × currentIndex) / RAY;
    
    const price = getAssetPrice(position.asset, blockNumber);
    const valueBase = (currentDebt × price) / (10n ** assetDecimals);
    
    totalDebtBase += valueBase;
  }
  
  // Calculate health factor
  if (totalDebtBase === 0n) {
    return { healthFactor: MAX_UINT256, totalCollateralBase, totalDebtBase };
  }
  
  // HF = (totalCollateral × avgLT) / totalDebt
  // avgLT = totalCollateralTimesLT / totalCollateralBase
  const healthFactor = (totalCollateralTimesLT × RAY) / (totalDebtBase × 10000n);
  
  return { healthFactor, totalCollateralBase, totalDebtBase };
}
```

#### Reserve Data Requirements

**For accurate offchain calculations, index these events/data per reserve:**

1. **ReserveDataUpdated Events** (critical):
   - `liquidityIndex` - For calculating supply balances
   - `variableBorrowIndex` - For calculating borrow balances
   - `liquidityRate` - For projecting index growth
   - `variableBorrowRate` - For projecting index growth
   - `timestamp` - For time-based calculations

2. **Reserve Configuration** (from `PoolConfigurator` or `UiPoolDataProviderV3`):
   - `decimals` - Token decimals
   - `liquidationThreshold` - Standard LT (basis points)
   - `ltv` - Loan-to-value ratio
   - `eModeCategory` - Which E-Mode category this reserve belongs to

3. **E-Mode Configuration** (per category):
   - `liquidationThreshold` - E-Mode LT (higher than standard)
   - `ltv` - E-Mode LTV (higher than standard)
   - `liquidationBonus` - E-Mode liquidation bonus

4. **Asset Prices**:
   - Store periodic price snapshots from oracle
   - Use for calculating USD values

---

#### E-Mode Accounting

**E-Mode affects liquidation thresholds and LTV:**

**When user has E-Mode enabled (categoryId > 0):**

1. **For each collateral asset:**
   ```typescript
   if (asset.eModeCategory === user.eModeCategory) {
     // Use E-Mode parameters
     liquidationThreshold = eModeConfig[categoryId].liquidationThreshold;
     ltv = eModeConfig[categoryId].ltv;
   } else {
     // Use standard parameters
     liquidationThreshold = reserveConfig.liquidationThreshold;
     ltv = reserveConfig.ltv;
   }
   ```

2. **Health factor calculation includes both:**
   ```
   HF = (In-Category Collateral × E-Mode LT + Out-Category Collateral × Standard LT) / Total Debt
   ```

3. **Track E-Mode changes:**
   - Store `UserEModeCategory` snapshot on every `UserEModeSet` event
   - Query latest E-Mode setting at calculation time

---

#### Accuracy Considerations

**Offchain Math Limitations:**

The offchain approach uses **linear interest approximation**:
```
newIndex ≈ oldIndex × (1 + rate × timeDelta / secondsPerYear)
```

Aave's actual on-chain math uses **compound interest** with per-second compounding. The approximation is:
- ✅ **Very accurate** for short time periods (< 1 day)
- ⚠️ **Slightly less accurate** for longer periods without updates
- ❌ **Can drift** if no `ReserveDataUpdated` events occur for extended periods

**Recommended: Periodic Smart Contract Refresh**

To maintain accuracy, implement a **periodic refresh job** that:

1. **Queries actual on-chain state** for all reserves:
   - Get all active users from tracking table
   - For each user, call `Pool.getUserAccountData()` and `UiPoolDataProviderV3.getUserReservesData()`
   - Update scaled balance snapshots in database with ground truth from chain
   - Store both scaled balances (`scaledATokenBalance`, `scaledVariableDebt`) and current balances

2. **Benefits:**
   - Corrects any drift from linear approximation
   - Catches any missed events
   - Ensures database stays synchronized with chain state
   - Dramatically reduces RPC usage compared to querying historical state

3. **Frequency Considerations:**
   - More frequent = more accurate but higher RPC costs
   - Less frequent = lower costs but potential drift
   - Suggested: Once per day, or based on specific accuracy requirements
   - Can adjust frequency dynamically based on market volatility

---

#### Complete Snapshot Workflow

**Historical Snapshot Calculation Process:**

High-level workflow for calculating snapshots across a block range:

1. **Get all users with positions** from active user tracking

2. **Determine snapshot blocks** based on desired granularity
   - Example: Every N blocks for periodic snapshots
   - Or: Specific blocks of interest (liquidations, major events)

3. **For each snapshot block:**
   - Get block timestamp
   - **Make 1 RPC call** to fetch reserve data (prices, indexes, rates) for all reserves
     - Call `UiPoolDataProviderV3.getReservesData(provider)` at this block
     - This returns data for all reserves in a single call
   - Cache this reserve data for all user calculations at this block
   
4. **For each user at this block:**
   - Get user's latest scaled positions from database (no RPC needed)
   - Calculate current balances using cached indexes from step 3 (no RPC needed)
   - Calculate health factor using cached prices from step 3 (no RPC needed)
   - Store `UserHealthFactorHistory` record
   - Store detailed `UserPositionBreakdown` for collateral and debt

5. **Result:** Complete historical snapshots with minimal RPC usage
   - **Only 1 RPC call per snapshot block** (regardless of number of users)
   - For 1,000 users across 100 blocks: 100 RPC calls instead of 100,000
   - **99.9% reduction** in RPC usage vs. querying each user individually

**Result:** Complete historical snapshots for all users without making RPC calls for historical state.

---

#### Performance Comparison

**Without Scaled Balance Optimization:**
- Example: 1,000 users × 365 snapshots = 365,000 RPC calls
- ~10-30 seconds per RPC call = Days of indexing time
- High cost from RPC provider
- Rate limiting issues

**With Scaled Balance Optimization:**
- 0 RPC calls for historical data (uses event-derived scaled balances)
- Optional: Periodic refresh calls (frequency based on accuracy requirements)
- Indexing completes in minutes instead of days
- 99%+ reduction in RPC usage

**Trade-off:** Slightly less accurate due to linear approximation, but accuracy maintained via periodic refreshes.
