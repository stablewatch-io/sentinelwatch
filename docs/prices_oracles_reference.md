# Prices & Oracles Reference

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** CHAINLINK/PYTH/REDSTONE/CHRONICLE oracle addresses have not had their pairs properly documented (some are ASSET/USD while others are ASSET/USDC). This needs to be fixed.

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive reference for pricing assets across various protocols and networks. Assets may be assigned **multiple price sources** to enable different use cases:

- **Priced Via**: Suggested primary pricing method (often a lending protocol oracle like Aave, Morpho, Sparklend)
- **Canonical1 & Canonical2**: Two suggested canonical price sources (on-chain oracles, on-chain methods, or off-chain APIs)
- **Alternative**: An alternative pricing method (if appropriate)
- **CoinGecko ID**: CoinGecko identifier for API-based pricing (where available)

### Why Multiple Price Sources?

1. **Protocol-Native Valuation**: Value lending protocol allocations and backings in the same terms as the protocol itself
2. **Sanity Checks**: Use canonical or alternative sources to verify protocol oracle prices
3. **Alerting**: Trigger alerts when different price sources diverge significantly
4. **Fallbacks**: Use alternative sources when primary sources are unavailable

### Reasoning for Oracle Selection

**General Principle**: We currently only use oracles when the asset is on the same chain as the oracle. This is a conservative starting restriction while we conduct further research. Many oracles, even when deployed on specific chains, appear to aggregate price sources primarily from other chains or CEXes not directly connected to that chain. We need to:
- Verify whether oracle price sources actually reflect chain-specific market conditions
- Determine if the price sources for each oracle can be identified
- Evaluate whether using oracles on different chains than the asset is valid or potentially even preferable in some cases

Until this research is complete, we default to same-chain usage. If an oracle's price source cannot be determined and it's on a different chain than the asset, we avoid using it.

The following priority order should guide oracle selection:

1. **Protocol-Native Oracles (Primary for Lending Assets)**: For assets within lending protocols (Aave, Morpho, Sparklend), always use the protocol's native oracle as the primary source. This ensures valuation consistency with the protocol itself.

2. **Chronicle (Highest Priority for Canonical Prices)**: Chronicle is our preferred primary oracle provider. However, **we currently only use Chronicle when the asset is on the same chain as the oracle**. Further research is needed to:
   - Determine whether Chronicle's aggregated price sources are safe to use in all cases
   - Validate whether using an oracle on a different chain than the asset is acceptable

3. **Chainlink (Second Priority)**: Chainlink is widely adopted and underlies many lending protocol oracles. **Important**: When using Chainlink as a fallback or sanity check, note that it may be the same underlying source as the protocol oracle, reducing independence.

4. **Redstone (Third Priority)**: Redstone push oracles have high price deviation thresholds and limited asset coverage, but provide valuable pricing for tokens without Chronicle or Chainlink alternatives.

5. **Chainlink Pull / Redstone Pull (Deprioritized)**: These pull oracles offer reliable, high-granularity pricing but are deprioritized due to higher technical complexity and monetary costs (gas fees per update). Use only when absolutely necessary.

6. **ERC4626 `totalAssets` (Supplementary Only)**: For ERC4626 vaults, the `totalAssets()` value provides a useful supplement to oracle prices but should **never be the primary choice**. This is not a market price and can be manipulated (e.g., by pausing redemptions).

7. **Issuer APIs (Last Resort)**: API-based pricing from issuers (Centrifuge, Maple, Securitize) should be avoided when possible due to manipulation risk and reliability concerns. **Note**: Some on-chain oracles may ultimately rely on issuer APIs and share the same manipulation vulnerability, but on-chain oracles avoid the downtime and availability issues associated with direct API dependencies.

### Which Assets to Price

**Scope**: Price all assets currently held by Stars and all assets that back those holdings.

**Backing Asset Discovery Methods**:
- **Lending Markets**: Identify possible collateral assets in protocols like Sparklend, Aave, Morpho
- **Issuer Websites**: Check composition for products like syrupUSDC via Maple
- **LP Pool Composition**: Analyze underlying assets in Uniswap and Curve pools

**Coverage Threshold**: This document covers all allocations and their backing assets valued **under $1M**. This cutoff avoids the overhead of pricing deprecated or low value allocations. As a starting point, $1M was chosen as a reasonable threshold, but this should be adjusted over time and the document updated.

**Temporal Scope**:
- **Current Assets Only**: Fetch current and historical prices for all assets that are **currently** held or backing allocations
- **Removed Assets**: If an asset was a backing in the past but is no longer, it can be ignored
- **Newly Added Assets**: When a backing asset is added, fetch all historical prices back to at least the time it was added as a backing

**Maintenance**: This document requires ongoing updates as new allocations are made and backing assets are added or removed from protocols, vaults, and LP pools.

### Special Value Notation

- **`tbd`** and **`unknown`**: Emphasized throughout - these require research and completion
- `n/a`: Preserved as-is - indicates not applicable

## Oracle Types

**Historical Data Note:** For push oracles (Chainlink, Chronicle, Redstone), historical prices can be retrieved by calling the "latest" functions (e.g., `latestRoundData()`, `latestAnswer()`) at a specific historical block number. This is the standard method for backfilling historical data, as the contract state at that block will return the price that was current at that time.

### Core
Reference the **Core Assets** section below to determine pricing. These are core assets with well-established on-chain oracles.

### Lending Protocol Native Oracles
Assets lent or borrowed on lending protocols (Aave, Morpho, Sparklend, etc.) have an oracle assigned to them at any given block. Fetch prices via the protocol's contracts using the oracle assigned to each reserve.

### Chainlink
Push oracle - each price feed has a dedicated smart contract address. Query the contract directly for the latest price.

**Key ABI Methods:**
```solidity
// Get latest price and round data
function latestRoundData() external view returns (
    uint80 roundId,
    int256 answer,
    uint256 startedAt,
    uint256 updatedAt,
    uint80 answeredInRound
);

// Get latest price only (deprecated, use latestRoundData)
function latestAnswer() external view returns (int256);

// Get historical round data
function getRoundData(uint80 _roundId) external view returns (
    uint80 roundId,
    int256 answer,
    uint256 startedAt,
    uint256 updatedAt,
    uint80 answeredInRound
);

// Get historical price only (deprecated, use getRoundData)
function getAnswer(uint256 roundId) external view returns (int256);
```

### Chronicle
Push oracle - each price feed has a dedicated smart contract address. Query the contract directly for the latest price.

**Key ABI Methods:**
```solidity
// Get latest price and round data
function latestRoundData() external view returns (
    uint80 roundId,
    int256 answer,
    uint256 startedAt,
    uint256 updatedAt,
    uint80 answeredInRound
);

// Get latest price only
function latestAnswer() external view returns (int256);

// Note: Chronicle does NOT support getRoundData() or getAnswer()
// However, historical prices can be retrieved by calling latestRoundData() or latestAnswer()
// at a specific historical block number during backfilling
```

### Redstone
Push oracle - each price feed has a dedicated smart contract address. Query the contract directly for the latest price.

**Key ABI Methods:**
```solidity
// Get latest price and round data
function latestRoundData() external view returns (
    uint80 roundId,
    int256 answer,
    uint256 startedAt,
    uint256 updatedAt,
    uint80 answeredInRound
);

// Get latest price only
function latestAnswer() external view returns (int256);

// Get round data - ONLY works with roundId = 1
// Will revert with "GetRoundDataCanBeOnlyCalledWithLatestRound" for any other roundId
function getRoundData(uint80 requestedRoundId) external view returns (
    uint80 roundId,
    int256 answer,
    uint256 startedAt,
    uint256 updatedAt,
    uint80 answeredInRound
);

// Note: Redstone roundId is ALWAYS 1 - historical rounds are not supported
```

### Chainlink Pull
Pull oracle requiring a paid blockchain transaction to fetch prices. Unlike push oracles, **all prices are fetched from a single contract using an ID** (e.g., `chainlinkId:0x0003...`). Avoid using these oracles where possible due to transaction fees.

**Key ABI Methods:**
```solidity
// Verify and retrieve price data (requires fee payment)
function verify(
    bytes calldata payload,
    bytes calldata parameterPayload
) external payable returns (bytes memory);

// Verify multiple price updates in bulk
function verifyBulk(
    bytes[] calldata payloads,
    bytes calldata parameterPayload
) external payable returns (bytes[] memory verifiedReports);
```

### Pyth Pull
Pull oracle requiring a paid blockchain transaction to fetch prices. **All prices are fetched from a single contract using an ID** (e.g., `pythId:0xe616...`). Avoid using these oracles where possible due to transaction fees.

**Note:** Pyth does offer push oracles, but they are extremely limited in number.

**Key ABI Methods:**
```solidity
// Update price feeds (requires fee payment)
function updatePriceFeeds(bytes[] calldata updateData) external payable;

// Parse and return price feed updates
function parsePriceFeedUpdates(
    bytes[] calldata updateData,
    bytes32[] calldata priceIds,
    uint64 minPublishTime,
    uint64 maxPublishTime
) external payable returns (PythStructs.PriceFeed[] memory priceFeeds);

// Get latest price (unsafe - may be stale)
function getPriceUnsafe(bytes32 id) external view returns (PythStructs.Price memory);

// Get latest price with staleness check
function getPrice(bytes32 id) external view returns (PythStructs.Price memory);

// Query complete price feed data
function queryPriceFeed(bytes32 id) external view returns (PythStructs.PriceFeed memory);
```

### External APIs
Off-chain data sources requiring HTTP requests. Currently, possible values are:
- **Centrifuge API**: Real-time prices for tokenized real-world assets (see `rwas_spec.md` for details)
- **Maple API**: Price data for Maple Finance assets (see `maple_spec.md` for details)
- **Securitize API**: Pricing for Securitize-issued tokens (see `rwas_spec.md` for details)

## Core Assets

Core assets used as underlying or backing assets across multiple protocols. **We will use the on-chain Ethereum price** for these assets. Take special note when these prices are referenced in situations that do not reflect Ethereum mainnet pricing.

## Backing Assets

Assets that are not necessarily held by a Star, but are the underlying for a lending allocation. These may need to be priced to determine the composition of lending allocations. The **Asset Pool** value matches a Star allocation to its complete set of backing assets.

**Note:** Contract addresses for backing assets were not included in the source data and need to be added.
